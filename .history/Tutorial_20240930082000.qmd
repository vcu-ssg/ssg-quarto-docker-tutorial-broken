     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```

### 4. Run a Test Container:
   - To ensure Docker is functioning properly, run a simple container like "Hello World":
   
     ```bash
     docker run hello-world
     ```
   - This command will download a test image and run it, outputting a message that confirms Docker is installed and working.

   - If you run a Docker command like `docker run hello-world` for the first time and see a message saying, "Unable to find the image locally", don't worry! This just means the image isn't on your machine yet. 
   - Docker will automatically start downloading the image from Docker Hub. Once the image is downloaded, it will run. 
  
# Step 2: Selecting a Base Image for Your Website 

When building a website using Docker, selecting the right base image is crucial. The base image provides the underlying operating system and the necessary software components. 

The choice of a base image depends on the needs of your project. Here are some common scenarios and the recommended base images:

# Prepare Your Website Files
Before you proceed, make sure you have the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for your website ready in a folder. This folder will also be where you create your Dockerfile.

### Creating Your Website Directory 

1. Create a New Folder 
First, create a new folder on your computer where you will store your website files. This folder will also contain the Dockerfile you'll create later. You can name this folder anything you like. 

`mkdir my-static-site`

1. Gather Your Static Files

#### Static Websites:
- **Nginx**: Ideal for serving static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Example: Use `nginx:alpine` for a lightweight, secure, and efficient static web server.
  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM nginx:alpine
  COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
