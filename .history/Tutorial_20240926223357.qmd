Step 1: Installing Docker on Your Mac

1. Download Docker Desktop for Mac: 
   - Go to [Docker Website](https://www.docker.com/)
   - Click on "Get Started"

   - Open Docker from your Applications folder.
   - You may be prompted to enter your email, so follow the on-screen instructions.

3. Verify the Installation:
   - Open a terminal and type the following command to check if Docker is installed correctly:
   
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```

   - You should see the version of Docker installed on your system, like `Docker version 20.10.8, build 3967b7d`.

4. Run a Test Container:
   - To ensure Docker is functioning properly, run a simple container like "Hello World":
   
     ```bash
     docker run hello-world
     ```
   - This command will download a test image and run it, outputting a message that confirms Docker is installed and working.

Step 2: Setting Up Your First Docker Container
1. Pull an Official Docker Image:
   - In the terminal, pull a popular image from Docker Hub, such as the latest version of Nginx, using the following command:
   
     ```bash
     docker pull nginx
     ```

2. Run the Nginx Container:
   - Now, run the container in detached mode (so it runs in the background) with this command:
   
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
     ```
   - This will start the Nginx web server and bind it to port 8080 on your machine. You can now access it by opening `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

3. Stopping the Container:
   - To stop the Nginx container, first find its container ID by running:
   
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
   - Then stop it using:
   
     ```bash
     docker stop <container_id>
     ```

4. Removing the Container:
   - Once the container is stopped, you can remove it using:
   
     ```bash
     docker rm <container_id>
     ```

Step 3: Building Your Own Docker Image
1. Create a Dockerfile:
   - In a new project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile`. This file will define how to build your custom Docker image.
   
   Example Dockerfile content:
   
   ```dockerfile
   FROM nginx:alpine
   COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
