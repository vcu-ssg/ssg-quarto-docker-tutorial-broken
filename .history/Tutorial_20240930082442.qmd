### 4. Run a Test Container:
   - To ensure Docker is working correctly, run the following command:

     ```bash
     docker run hello-world
     ```

   - This will download and run a test container, confirming that Docker is installed properly.

   - If you see a message like "Unable to find the image locally", it simply means the image is being downloaded from Docker Hub.
   - Once downloaded, Docker will run the test image, and you should see a confirmation message.

# Step 2: Selecting a Base Image for Your Website

Selecting the right base image for your website is essential when using Docker. The base image provides the operating system and necessary software components for your project.

### Static Websites:
- **Nginx**: Ideal for serving static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Recommended Image: `nginx:alpine`, which is lightweight, secure, and efficient for static websites.

   ```dockerfile
   FROM nginx:alpine
   COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
