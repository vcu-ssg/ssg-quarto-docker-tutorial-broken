## 4. Run a Test Container:
   - To ensure Docker is functioning properly, run a simple container like "Hello World":
   
     ```bash
     docker run hello-world
     ```
   - This command will download a test image and run it, outputting a message that confirms Docker is installed and working.

   - If you run a Docker command like `docker run hello-world` for the first time and see a message saying, "Unable to find the image locally", don't worry! This just means the image isn't on your machine yet. 
   - Docker will automatically start downloading the image from Docker Hub. Once the image is downloaded, it will run.
