title: Using docker-compose
---

- Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define and run multi-container applications. With one command, you can create and launch all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- If Docker Desktop is installed on your machines, Docker Compose should already be included. If not, they need to install it separately. You can check if itâ€™s installed by running:

```bash
   docker-compose --version
```

## Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

- Navigate to the root of your project where Dockerfile is also located, create a `docker-compose.yml` file. Below is a simple docker-compose.yml for a static site served by Nginx.

```bash
   version: '3.8'
   services:
   nginx:
      image: nginx:alpine
      ports:
         - "8089:80"
      volumes:
         - ./my-folder:/usr/share/nginx/html
```

## Build and Run Containers

- Run the command below in your terminal from the root of your project

```bash
   docker-compose up -d
```

- The `-d` flag runs containers in the background.
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:<port>/ to verify that your service is running correctly.
- Adjust <port> based on your docker-compose.yml settings. In my example I use port 8089
- Use `docker-compose ps` to check the status of running services.
